## Functional, multi-objective protein design using continuous relaxation.


> **WARNING**: Unlike [BindCraft](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09429-6) (which is a well-tested and well-tuned method for generic binder design), `mosaic` may require substantial hand-holding (tuning learning rates, etc), often produces proteins that fail simple in-silico tests, should be combined with standard filtering methods, etc. This is not for the faint of heart: the intent is to provide a framework in which to implement custom objective functions and optimization algorithms for your application. You can read about some applications in [our blog](https://blog.escalante.bio).

> **WARNING**: We rely heavily on just-in-time compilation via JAX; the first call to a JAX-compiled function will be slow. After that things should be pretty fast. If you're tuning loss weights or optimizer parameters, you should use an interactive session or a notebook!

### Why?

`mosaic` is an attempt to reimplement a zoo of protein property models with a common interface to make it easier to run them together without dealing with containers, horrible dependencies, etc. Because they're all implemented using the same backend (JAX), they can be efficiently and conveniently connected with code rather than bash scripts. We use this for protein binder design, but there are many applications.

Protein design tasks almost always involve multiple constraints or properties that must be satisfied or optimized. For instance, in binder design one may want to simultaneously ensure:
- the chance of binding the intended target is high  
- the chance of binding to a similar off-target protein is low
- the binder expresses well in bacteria
- the binder is highly soluble. 

There has been a recent explosion in the application of machine learning to protein property prediction, resulting in fairly accurate predictors for each of these properties. What is currently lacking is an efficient and flexible method for combining these different predictors into one design/filtering/ranking framework.

### Installation
We recommend using `uv`, e.g. run `uv sync --group jax-cuda` after cloning the repo to install dependencies.

To run the example notebook try `uv run marimo edit examples/example_notebook.py`.

> You may need to add various `uv` overrides for specific packages and your machine, take a look at [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml)

> You'll need a GPU or TPU-compatible version of JAX for structure prediction. You might need to install this manually, i.e. `uv add jax[cuda12]`.


### Introduction

This project combines two simple components to make a powerful protein design framework:

- A functional, modular interface to easily combine multiple learned or hand-crafted loss terms and optimization algorithms (as in [A high-level programming language for generative protein design](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.21.521526v1.full.pdf) etc)
- Gradient-based optimization over a continuous, relaxed sequence space (as in [ColabDesign](https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabDesign), [RSO](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adq1741), BindCraft, etc)

The key observation is that it's possible to use this continuous relaxation simultaneously with multiple learned objective terms [^1]. 

This allows us to easily construct objective functions that are combinations of multiple learned potentials and optimize them efficiently, like so:

```python
from mosaic.models.boltz1 import Boltz1
from mosaic.structure_prediction import TargetChain
import mosaic.losses.structure_prediction as sp
from mosaic.losses.protein_mpnn import InverseFoldingSequenceRecovery
from mosaic.proteinmpnn.mpnn import ProteinMPNN
from mosaic.optimizers import simplex_APGM
import jax
import numpy as np

boltz1 = Boltz1()
mpnn = ProteinMPNN.from_pretrained()

target_sequence = "DYSFSCYSQLEVNGSQHSLTCAFE..."
binder_length = 80

# Generate features for binder-target complex
boltz_features, _ = boltz1.binder_features(
    binder_length=binder_length,
    chains=[TargetChain(sequence=target_sequence)],
)

# Generate features for binder alone (monomer)
mono_features, _ = boltz1.binder_features(
    binder_length=binder_length,
    chains=[]
)

combined_loss = (
    boltz1.build_loss(
        loss=4 * sp.BinderTargetContact()
        + sp.DistogramRadiusOfGyration(target_radius=15.0)
        + sp.WithinBinderContact()
        + 0.3 * sp.HelixLoss()
        + 5.0 * InverseFoldingSequenceRecovery(mpnn, temp=jax.numpy.array(0.01)),
        features=boltz_features,
        recycling_steps=1,
    )
    + 0.5 * esm_loss
    + trigram_ll
    + 0.1 * stability_loss
    + 0.5
    * boltz1.build_loss(
        loss=0.2 * sp.PLDDTLoss()
        + sp.DistogramRadiusOfGyration(target_radius=15.0)
        + 0.3 * sp.HelixLoss(),
        features=mono_features,
        recycling_steps=1,
    )
)

_, PSSM = simplex_APGM(
    loss_function=combined_loss,
    n_steps=150,
    x=jax.nn.softmax(
        0.5 * jax.random.gumbel(
            key=jax.random.key(np.random.randint(100000)),
            shape=(binder_length, 20),
        )
    ),
    stepsize=0.1,
    momentum=0.9,
)

```

Here we're using ~5 different models to construct a loss function: the [Boltz-1](https://github.com/jwohlwend/boltz) structure prediction model (which is used _twice_: once to predict the binder-target complex and once to predict the binder as a monomer), ESM2, ProteinMPNN, an n-gram model, and a stability model trained on the [mega-scale](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06328-6) dataset. 

It's super easy to define additional loss terms, which are JIT-compatible callable pytrees, e.g.

```python
class LogPCysteine(LossTerm):
    def __call__(self, soft_sequence: Float[Array, "N 20"], key = None):
        mean_log_p = jnp.log(soft_sequence[:, IDX_CYS] + 1E-8).mean()
        return mean_log_p, {"log_p_cys": mean_log_p}

```
Though a better way to exclude cysteine is to wrap an existing loss, as in [`NoCys`](src/mosaic/losses/transformations.py).

> **WARNING**: Optimization is hard: it's quite easy to create an objective function that's difficult to minimize using our standard optimizers. For many design problems you may have to come up with your own heuristic optimization algorithms (for instance by guiding generative models or combining multiple designs).


There's no reason custom loss terms can't involve more expensive (differentiable) operations, e.g. an [EVOLVEpro-style fitness predictor](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adr6006).

The [marimo notebooks](examples) give a few examples of how this can work.


It's very easy to swap in different optimizers. For instance, let's say we really wanted to try projected gradient descent on the hypercube $[0,1]^N$. We can implement that in a few lines of code:

```python
from mosaic.optimizers import _print_iter, _eval_loss_and_grad
def RSO_box(
    *,
    loss_function,
    x: Float[Array, "N 20"],
    n_steps: int,
    stepsize: float,
    max_grad_norm: float,
    key=None,
):
    if key is None:
        key = jax.random.PRNGKey(np.random.randint(0, 10000))
    
    for _iter in range(n_steps):
        (v, aux), g = _eval_loss_and_grad(
            x=x,
            loss_function=loss_function,
            key=key
        )
        g_norm = np.linalg.norm(g)
        if g_norm > max_grad_norm:
            g = g * (max_grad_norm / g_norm)
        x = (x - stepsize * g).clip(0,1)
        key = jax.random.fold_in(key, 0)
        _print_iter(_iter, aux, v)

    return x
```

Take a look at [optimizers.py](src/mosaic/optimizers.py) for examples.

#### Structure Prediction
---

We provide a simple interface in `mosaic.structure_prediction` and `mosaic.models.*` to ten structure prediction models: `OpenFold3`, `Boltz1`, `Boltz2`, `AF2`, `ProtenixMini`, `ProtenixTiny`, `ProtenixBase`, `Protenix2025`, `ESMFold2`, and `OpenDDE` (`OpenDDEModelV1` / `OpenDDEModelAbag`).


To make a prediction or design a binder, you'll need to make a list of `mosaic.structure_prediction.TargetChain` objects. This is a simple dataclass that contains a protein (or DNA or RNA) sequence, a flag to tell the model if it should use MSAs (`use_msa`), and potentially a template structure (as a `gemmi.Chain`).

For example, we can make a prediction with Protenix for IL7Ra like so:

```python

import jax
from mosaic.structure_prediction import TargetChain
from mosaic.models.protenix import Protenix2025


model = Protenix2025()

target_sequence = "DYSFSCYSQLEVNGSQHSLTCAFEDPDVNTTNLEFEICGALVEVKCLNFRKLQEIYFIETKKFLLIGKSNICVKVGEKSLTCKKIDLTTIVKPEAPFDLSVVYREGANDFVVTFNTSHLQKKYVKVLMHDVAYRQEKDENKWTHVNLSSTKLTLLQRKLQPAAMYEIKVRSIPDHYFKGFWSEWSPSYYFRT"


# generate features and a "writer" object that turns model output into a prediction wrapper
target_only_features, target_only_structure = model.target_only_features(
    [TargetChain(target_sequence)]
)

prediction = model.predict(
    features=target_only_features,
    writer=target_only_structure,
    key=jax.random.key(0),
    recycling_steps=10,
)

# prediction contains useful properties like `prediction.st`, `prediction.pae` etc.
```

This interface is the same for all structure prediction models, so in theory we should be able to replace `Protenix2025` above with `Boltz2` by changing only a single line of code!

We also define a collection of (model agnostic!) structure prediction related losses [here](src/mosaic/losses/structure_prediction.py). It's super easy to define your own using the provided interface.


> In practice there are three types of structure prediction losses: those that rely on the trunk, structure module, or confidence module. Under JIT, JAX will prune code related to the structure module and confidence module if they're not needed; so if your loss only relies on the trunk it will be quite fast.


Continuing the example above, we can construct a loss and do design as follows:

```python
import mosaic.losses.structure_prediction as sp
from mosaic.optimizers import simplex_APGM
import numpy as np

binder_length = 80

design_features, design_structure = model.binder_features(
    binder_length=binder_length, chains=[TargetChain(target_sequence)]
)

loss = model.build_loss(
    loss=sp.BinderTargetContact() + sp.WithinBinderContact(), features=design_features, recycling_steps=2
)

PSSM = jax.nn.softmax(
    0.5
    * jax.random.gumbel(
        key=jax.random.key(np.random.randint(100000)),
        shape=(binder_length, 20),
    )
)

_, PSSM = simplex_APGM(
    loss_function=loss,
    x=PSSM,
    n_steps=50,
    stepsize=0.15,
    momentum=0.3,
)
```

Each `StructurePrediction` object also contains  a `StructureModelOutput` in `model_output`. This can be useful for inspection, debugging loss terms, and chaining models. For example, to inverse fold directly from a prediction:

```python
import jax
from mosaic.structure_prediction import TargetChain
from mosaic.models.boltz2 import Boltz2
from mosaic.proteinmpnn.mpnn import load_mpnn_sol
from mosaic.losses.protein_mpnn import inverse_fold
from mosaic.common import TOKENS

boltz2 = Boltz2()
features, writer = boltz2.target_only_features([TargetChain(SEQUENCE, use_msa=True)])
pred = boltz2.predict(
    PSSM=jax.nn.one_hot([TOKENS.index(c) for c in SEQUENCE], 20),
    features=features, writer=writer,
    recycling_steps=3, sampling_steps=25, key=jax.random.key(0),
)

mpnn = load_mpnn_sol(0.05)
ids = inverse_fold(
    mpnn=mpnn, binder_length=len(SEQUENCE),
    output=pred.model_output, temp=0.001,
    key=jax.random.key(0),
)
print("".join(TOKENS[int(i)] for i in ids))
```

Set `method="jacobi"` to use approximate parallel decoding; `jacobi_iterations`
controls its number of refinement steps.

> Every structure prediction model also supports a lower-level feature + losses interfaces if you'd like to do something fancy (e.g. design a protein binder against a small molecule with Boltz or Protenix).

> **WARNING**: AF3-style models (all structure models except for AF2) have at least three input channels related to the binder sequence: the token channel, the MSA, and the reference atomic positions channel. That last one is quite difficult to deal with in a differentiable and JIT-friendly manner during design because each amino acid has a different number of atoms. To get around this we distinguish between two types of features: target-only features and binder features. For binder features (those related to the binder that will be used during design) we use either UNK or G for the reference atomic position channel. This means that predictions using design features _do not have sidechains_. This doesn't seem to affect performance for most models. If you like sidechains you can repredict your designs with target-only features for both the binder and target.


#### Protenix
---

See [protenij.py](examples/protenij.py) for an example of how to use this family of models. This loss function supports some advanced features to speed up hallucination, namely "pre-cycling" (running multiple recycling iterations on the target alone _before_ design).


#### ProteinMPNN
---

Load your preferred ProteinMPNN (soluble or vanilla) model using 

```python
from mosaic.proteinmpnn.mpnn import ProteinMPNN

mpnn = ProteinMPNN.from_pretrained()
```

In the simplest case we have a single-chain structure or complex where the protein we're designing occurs as the first chain (note this can be a prediction). We can then construct the (negative) log-likelihood of the designed sequence under ProteinMPNN as a loss term:
```python
from mosaic.losses.protein_mpnn import FixedStructureInverseFoldingLL
import gemmi

inverse_folding_LL = FixedStructureInverseFoldingLL.from_structure(gemmi.read_structure("scaffold.pdb"), mpnn)
```
This can then be added to whatever overall loss function you're constructing. 

Note that it is often helpful to clip the loss using, e.g.,  `ClippedLoss(inverse_folding_LL, 2, 100)`: over-optimizing ProteinMPNN likelihoods typically results in homopolymers. 

#### ProteinMPNN + structure prediction
---
ProteinMPNN can also be combined with live structure predictions. Mathematically this is
$-\log P_\theta(s | AF2(s)),$ the log-likelihood of the sequence $s$ under inverse folding _of the predicted structure for that sequence_.
This loss term is `ProteinMPNNLoss.`

Another very useful loss term is `InverseFoldingSequenceRecovery`: a continuous relaxation of sequence recovery after sampling with ProteinMPNN (roughly $\langle s, -E_{z \sim p_\theta(\cdot | AF2(s))} [z] \rangle$). We've found this term often speeds up design and increases filter pass rates.

```python
from mosaic.losses.protein_mpnn import InverseFoldingSequenceRecovery

# Include as part of a structure prediction loss
loss = model.build_loss(
    loss=sp.BinderTargetContact()
    + sp.WithinBinderContact()
    + 5.0 * InverseFoldingSequenceRecovery(mpnn, temp=jax.numpy.array(0.01)),
    features=features,
)
```


#### ESM
---

Another useful loss term is the pseudolikelihood of the ESM2 protein language model (via [esm2quinox](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/esm2quinox/tree/main)), which is correlated with all kinds of useful properties (solubility, expressibility, etc).

This term can be constructed as follows:
```python
import esm
import esm2quinox
from mosaic.losses.esm import ESM2PseudoLikelihood

torch_model, _ = esm.pretrained.esm2_t33_650M_UR50D()
ESM2PLL = ESM2PseudoLikelihood(esm2quinox.from_torch(torch_model))
```

In typical practice this loss should be clipped or squashed to avoid over-optimization (e.g. `ClippedLoss(ESM2PLL, 2, 100)`).

We also implement the corresponding loss for ESMC (via [esmjfold2](https://github.com/escalante-bio/esmjfold2)).
```python
from mosaic.losses.esmc import load_esmc, ESMCPseudoLikelihood

# model_name is an alias (esmc_300m / esmc_600m / esmc_6b) or a raw HuggingFace id
esmc = load_esmc("esmc_300m")
ESMCPLL = ESMCPseudoLikelihood(esmc)
```

`load_esmc` converts the checkpoint to JAX via torch + the Biohub `transformers` fork (both pulled in as dependencies). A pseudo-*perplexity* variant, `ESMCPseudoPerplexity`, is also available.

#### Stability
---

A simple delta G predictor trained on the megascale dataset. Might be a nice example of how to train and add a simple regression head on a small amount of data: [train.py](src/mosaic/stability_model/train.py).

```python
from mosaic.losses.stability import StabilityModel

stability_loss = StabilityModel.from_pretrained(esm)
```

#### AbLang
---
[AbLang](https://github.com/oxpig/AbLang), a family of antibody-specific language models.

```python
import ablang
import jablang
from mosaic.losses.ablang import AbLangPseudoLikelihood

heavy_ablang = ablang.pretrained("heavy")
heavy_ablang.freeze()

abpll = AbLangPseudoLikelihood(
    model=jablang.from_torch(heavy_ablang.AbLang),
    tokenizer=heavy_ablang.tokenizer,
    stop_grad=True,
)
```


#### Trigram
---

A trigram language model as in [A high-level programming language for generative protein design](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.21.521526v1.full.pdf).

```python
from mosaic.losses.trigram import TrigramLL

trigram_ll = TrigramLL.from_pkl()
```

### Optimizers and loss transformations
---

We include some standard [optimizers](src/mosaic/optimizers.py).


First, `simplex_APGM`, which is an accelerated proximal gradient algorithm on the probability simplex. One critical hyperparameter is the stepsize, a reasonable first guess is `0.1*np.sqrt(binder_length)`. Another useful keyword argument is `scale`, which corresponds to $\ell_2$ regularization. Values larger than `1.0` encourage sparse solutions; a typical binder design run might start with `scale=1.0` to get an initial, soft solution and then ramp up to something higher to get a discrete solution. 

`simplex_APGM` also accepts a keyword argument, `logspace`, to run the algorithm in logspace, e.g. as an accelerated proximal bregman method. In this case `scale` corresponds to (negative) entropic regularization: values greater than one encourage sparsity. 

`batched_simplex_APGM` is an internally-vmapped version of `simplex_APGM` -- useful if you've got a small target or large GPU (or both!), where it can increase throughput several fold.

We also include a discrete optimization algorithm, `gradient_MCMC`, which is a variant of MCMC with a proposal distribution defined using a taylor approximation to the objective function (see [Plug & Play Directed Evolution of Proteins with Gradient-based Discrete MCMC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09925).) This algorithm is especially useful for finetuning either existing designs or the result of continuous optimization.




#### Loss transformations

We also provide a few [common transformations of loss functions](src/mosaic/losses/transformations.py). Of note are `ClippedLoss`, which wraps and clips another loss term. 

`SetPositions` and `FixedPositionsPenalty` are useful for fixing certain positions of an existing design. 

`ClippedGradient` and `NormedGradient` respectively clip and normalize the gradients of individual loss terms, this can be useful when combining predictors with very different gradient norms, for example:
```python
loss = ClippedGradient(inverse_folding_LL, 1.0)  
    + ClippedGradient(ablang_pll, 1.0)
    + 0.25 * ClippedGradient(ESMCPLL, 1.0)
```

### Extensive theoretical discussion

Hallucination-based protein design workflows attempt to solve the following optimization problem:

$$\underset{s \in A^n}{\textrm{minimize}}~\ell(s).$$

Here $A$ is the set of amino acids, so the decision variable $s$ ranges over all protein sequences of length $n$. $~\ell: A^n \rightarrow \mathbf{R}$ is a loss functional that evaluates the quality of the protein $s$. In typical practice $\ell$ is some function of the output of a neural network; i.e. in [ColabDesign](https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabDesign) $\ell$ might be (negative) average pLDDT from AlphaFold. 

One challenge with naive approaches is that $A^n$ is extremely large and discrete optimization is difficult; while MCMC and other discrete algorithms have been used (see, e.g., [Rives et al](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.21.521526v1.full.pdf)) they are often *very* slow. 

ColabDesign, RSO, and BindCraft, among others, use the fact that $\ell$ has a particular structure that allows for a continuous relaxation of the original problem: almost every neural network first encodes the sequence $s$ into a one-hot matrix $P \in \mathbf{R}^{(n, c)}$. If we consider $\ell$ as a functional on $\mathbf{R}^{(n, c)}$ we can use automatic differentiation to do continuous optimization on either $\mathbf{R}^{(n, c)}$ or $\Delta_c^n$ ($n$ products of the probability simplex). 

> This is related to the classic optimization trick of optimizing over distributions rather than single points. First, $\underset{x}{\textrm{minimize }}f(x)$ is relaxed to $\underset{p \in \Delta}{\textrm{minimize }}E_p f(x)$. Next, if it makes sense to take the expectation of $x$ (as in the one-hot sequence case), we can interchange $f$ and $E$ to get the final relaxation: $$\underset{p \in \Delta}{\textrm{minimize }} f( E_p x) = \underset{p \in \Delta}{\textrm{minimize }} f(p).$$


Solutions to this relaxed optimization problem must then be translated into sequences; many different methods work here: RSO uses inverse folding of the predicted structure, BindCraft/ColabDesign uses a softmax with ramping temperature to encourage one-hot solutions, etc. 

By default we use a generalized proximal gradient method (mirror descent with entropic regularization) to do optimization over the simplex and to encourage sparse solutions, though it is very easy to swap in other optimization algorithms (e.g. projected gradient descent or composition with a softmax as in ColabDesign). 

Typically $\ell$ is formed by a single neural network (or an ensemble of the same architecture), but in practice we're interested in simultaneously optimizing different properties predicted by different neural networks. This has the added benefit of reducing the chance of finding so-called adversarial sequences. 

This kind of modular implementation of loss terms is also useful with modern RL-based alignment of generative models approaches: these forms of alignment can often be seen as _amortized optimization_. Typically, they train a generative model to minimize some combination of KL divergence minus a loss function, which can be a combination of in-silico predictors. We demonstrate exactly this — finetuning and RL-aligning a generative model (BoltzGen) against a `mosaic` loss functional — in [Teaching generative models to hallucinate](https://blog.escalante.bio/teaching-generative-models-to-hallucinate/). Another use case is to provide guidance to discrete diffusion or flow models. 

[^1]: This requires us to treat neural networks as _simple parametric functions_ that can be combined programmatically; **not** as complicated software packages that require large libraries (e.g. PyTorch lightning), bash scripts, or containers as is common practice in BioML.
